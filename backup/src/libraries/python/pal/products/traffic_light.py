# Traffic Light Client
"""
This script provides a user-friendly library to interact with traffic lights. 
It establishes a connection to a Raspberry Pi Zero W running a micro-controller that controls the traffic light LEDs. 
The library offers functionalities to control the traffic lights manually (setting them to red, yellow, or green) or switch them to an automatic timed mode. 
It also allows for turning off the lights and starting or stopping a stream.
