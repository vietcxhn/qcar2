/*
    Description:

    This function allocates the given number of bytes of memory
    on the stack. This memory is owned by the process. It returns a pointer
    to the allocated memory. It generates a stack overflow exception
    if the memory could not be allocated so do not use this function
    for large memory allocations!

    The memory is not zero-initialized. It does not need to be freed
    as it will be free automatically when the variable goes out of scope.

    NOTE: stack_free MUST be called to release the allocated memory as some
          platforms use the heap instead of the stack.

    Parameters:

    num_bytes = the number of bytes to allocate

    Return values:

    A pointer to the allocated memory.

    Description:

    This function resizes a memory block. The memory must be
    owned by the process. It returns a pointer to the reallocated
    memory or NULL if the reallocation failed. The returned pointer
    is not guaranteed to be the same as the original memory
    pointer. In this case, the original memory is copied over
    to the new memory. If the size of the memory block is increased
    the extra memory is not zero-initialized.

    If the memory pointer passed in is NULL then a new memory block
    is allocated.

    If the reallocation fails then the original memory block remains
    valid so be sure to maintain a pointer to the original memory.

    However, if the reallocation succeeds and new memory had to be
    allocated than the original memory block will be no longer be
    valid.

    Parameters:

    memory    = a pointer to the original memory block (may be NULL)
    num_bytes = the number of bytes to which to resize the memory block

    Return values:

    A pointer to the reallocated memory. If there's not enough memory
