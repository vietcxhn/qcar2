/*
    Name:   hil_get_version

    Description:

    This function fills in the t_version structure passed as an argument with the
    current version of the HIL API. Before calling this function, initialize the
    size field of the t_version structure with the size of the t_version structure.
    For example,
    
        t_version version;
        t_error result;

        version.size = sizeof(version);
        result = hil_get_version(&version);

    The version structure is defined in quanser_version.h. It contains the major
    and minor release numbers as well as the release and build numbers.

    Parameters:

    version = the address of a t_version structure to be filled in by the call

    Return value:

    Returns 0 on success. If an error occurs then a negative error code is returned.

/*
    Name:   hil_open

    Description:

    Opens a particular instance of a hardware-in-the-loop or data acquisition card.
    The type of card to open is specified by the card_type parameter. For example,
    the string "q8" identifies Quanser's Q8 card. 
    
    The card_identifier field is used to differentiate between multiple instances 
    of a board. For example, if there is more than one Q8 in the system, then an 
    identifier of "0" would be used for the first board and an identifier of "1" 
    for the second board. In general, the card identifier is the string representation
    of a zero-based index. In other words, "0" represents the first board of the
    given type in the system, "1" represents the second board, etc. However, some
    drivers support other options for the card identifier. For example, the NI drivers
    for the QUARC Windows target allow the name of the board to be specified as it
    appears in the NI Measurement and Automation Explorer (MAX). For example, for the NI
    cards, "Dev1" may be used as a card identifier if that is the name given to a
    card in MAX. Read the QUARC documentation specific to your card for more information
    on the card identifier.

    The final argument is the address of a t_card handle in which the hil_open function
    stores the handle to the board. All but a couple of the HIL API functions require
    this handle in order to identify the board. The handle is an opaque data structure
    whose fields cannot (and should not) be accessed.

    If the card identifier is preceded by a '*' e.g. "*myboard" then the name following
    the '*' is located as a value under the registry key SOFTWARE/Quanser/QUARC/Cards/<card_type>/
    and the registry value associated with that name is used as the card identifier instead.
    This mechanism allows card identifiers to be configured externally so that
    "virtual card names" may be assigned.

    If the card identifier contains takes the form <card id>@<uri> then the card is
    accessed remotely via the URI. The URI must refer to a HIL Proxy Server which is
    interfacing with the actual HIL device on a remote machine.

    Parameters:

    card_type       = a string indicating the type of card e.g. "q8", "q3_controlpaq_fw"
    card_identifier = a string identifying the particular instance of that card type e.g. "0", "Dev1"
    card            = the address of a t_card variable in which to store the handle to the card

    Return value:

    Returns 0 on success. If an error occurs then a negative error code is returned.

    num_channels    = the number of channels in the analog_channels array
    minimums        = an array of doubles (t_double) containing the minimum value of the input
                      range for the corresponding channel in the analog_channels array. This
                      array must be the same size as the analog_channels array.
    maximums        = an array of doubles (t_double) containing the maximum value of the input
                      range for the corresponding channel in the analog_channels array. This
                      array must be the same size as the analog_channels array.

    Return value:

    then the count values should be specified within the appropriate range.

    Parameters:

    Description:

    Sets the quadrature mode of the encoder inputs on the card. Many cards do not
    support encoders. Cards which do provide encoders may not support different
    quadrature modes, or may not support different quadrature modes for each
    channel. Valid quadrature modes are:

        ENCODER_QUADRATURE_NONE = No quadrature. Inputs are count and direction.
        ENCODER_QUADRATURE_1X   = 1X. Inputs are A and B channels.
        ENCODER_QUADRATURE_2X   = 2X. Inputs are A and B channels.
        ENCODER_QUADRATURE_4X   = 4X. Inputs are A and B channels.

    The Quanser Q8-series support all the quadrature modes and each channel may
    be assigned a different mode. The 4X quadrature mode is typically the mode used
    for encoders because it provides the highest encoder resolution. The non-quadrature
    mode is used for frequency counting and other applications where count and direction
    inputs are required rather than standard A/B encoder inputs.

    Parameters:

    Description:

    Some cards support filtering of their encoder inputs. This function sets the filter
    frequency of the encoder inputs on the card. Note that many cards do not
    support encoders. Cards which do provide encoders may not support filtering or different
    filter frequencies, or may not support different filter frequencies for each
    channel.

    The Quanser Q8-series support programmable filter frequencies and each channel may
    be assigned a different frequency. The fastest frequency is generally used so that
    the encoder inputs can handle the fastest possible A/B inputs. A slower filter
    frequency may be required in noisy environments. However, be aware that noisy
    encoder inputs is often an indication of a grounding problem or inadequate shielding,
    so be sure to check ground and shield connections carefully before resorting to
    more filtering of the encoder inputs. Filter frequencies will be rounded to the
    nearest filter frequency supported by the card.

    Parameters:

    card             = a t_card variable containing the handle to the card. It must be obtained

    Sets the direction of digital I/O lines. Many cards which support digital I/O allow
    the digital I/O lines to be programmed as inputs or outputs. Some cards organize the
    digital I/O into "ports" and only allow the direction of the port as a whole to be
    programmed. Others, like the Quanser Q8-series, allow each digital I/O line to be
    programmed individually. Pass this function a list of all those digital I/O lines
    which should be configured as inputs and a list of those to be programmed as outputs.
    Any digital I/O lines not present in either list will be left untouched. Cards
    which group digital I/O lines into "ports" and only allow the direction of the port 
    to be configured should return an error if some of the digital I/O lines in the port

        DIGITAL_OPEN_COLLECTOR_CONFIGURATION = use an open-collector output (passive high, active low)
    Cards which have totem-pole outputs normally drive the output high or low actively. However,

    and active low for a "low" output. This function allows this emulation to be configured. Some
    cards allow the configuration to be programmed on a per-channel basis.

    Parameters:

    Name:   hil_set_clock_mode

    Description:

    Sets the mode of hardware timers on the card. Many cards support at least one
    timer. This timer may be multi-purpose, which different modes available. For
    example, the Quanser Q8-series has two 32-bit counters. Each counter may be
    configured as a clock (hardware timebase) or a PWM output. Other cards allow
    their counters to be used as a clock or an encoder counter. Not all cards
    support this flexibility and will return an error if the desired mode is
    unavailable. The modes currently available for this function are:

        CLOCK_TIMEBASE_MODE = use clock as hardware timebase (default)
        CLOCK_PWM_MODE      = use clock for PWM output
        CLOCK_ENCODER_MODE  = use clock as an encoder input

    Clocks are specified using one of the HARDWARE_CLOCK_<n> constants defined
    in this header file. The first clock is HARDWARE_CLOCK_0, the second clock
    is HARDWARE_CLOCK_1, etc. These constants are merely provided for greater
    readability. Hardware clocks may also be specified as a zero-based index,
    with 0 being the first clock, 1 being the second clock, etc. Thus, there
    may be more clocks on the card than there are HARDWARE_CLOCK_<n> constants.

    Note that this function may change the number of PWM channels available. Therefore,
    this function should be called prior to any of the PWM functions, in general.

    Parameters:

    card        = a t_card variable containing the handle to the card. It must be obtained

    clocks      = an array of t_clock values containing the clocks whose modes will be set.
                  Clock numbers are zero-based. Thus, clock 0 is the first clock, clock 1 
                  the second clock, etc. Use the HARDWARE_CLOCK_<n> constants for greater
                  readability.

/*
    Name:   hil_set_pwm_mode

    Description:

    Sets the mode used for the PWM channels. Most cards do not support different modes
    for their PWM channels but the Quanser Q8-series do. The duty cycle of PWM outputs
    is typically what is varied when driving these outputs, while maintaining a fixed
    PWM frequency. However, the Q8-series also allow the frequency or period of the PWM 
    outputs to be varied while maintaining a fixed duty cycle. Such frequency modulation
    is analogous to an FM radio signal, which also modulates frequency. Valid modes are:
    
        PWM_DUTY_CYCLE_MODE = PWM outputs vary in duty cycle
        PWM_FREQUENCY_MODE  = PWM outputs vary in frequency
        PWM_PERIOD_MODE     = PWM outputs vary in period

    Changing the PWM output mode affects how the values provided to functions such as 
    hil_write_pwm are interpreted. In duty cycle mode, which is the default, the input 
    to hil_write_pwm is treated as a duty cycle. Valid values range from -1 to 1, where
    a magnitude of 1 indicates a 100% duty cycle and 0 means a 0% duty cycle. The sign
    determines the direction. For cards with bipolar PWM outputs, the sign determines
    the polarity of the output. Otherwise the sign may change the value of another
    output pin or negative duty cycles will not be supported by the card.
    
    In frequency mode, the values passed to functions such as hil_write_pwm are interpreted 
    as new PWM frequencies in Hz. 
    
    Finally, in period mode, the values are treated as new PWM periods (1 / frequency) 
    in seconds.

    Parameters:

    card            = a t_card variable containing the handle to the card. It must be obtained
                      using the hil_open function.

                      channels whose counter values will be set. Channel numbers are zero-based. 
                      Thus, channel 0 is the first channel, channel 1 the second channel, etc.
    num_channels    = the number of channels in the pwm_channels array
    mode            = an array of t_pwm_mode values containing the new PWM modes for

/*
    Name:   hil_set_pwm_configuration

    Description:

    Sets the configuration of the PWM output channels. Most cards do not support different
    configurations for their PWM channels but the Quanser QPID does. A PWM output configuration
    consists of a number of parameters:

        - whether each PWM channel is an independent unipolar output, a bipolar output,
          or whether the outputs are paired to make complementary outputs.
        - whether the PWM signals are edge-aligned or center-aligned
        - the polarity of the output (whether the duty cycle refers to the high pulse or low pulse width)

    Parameters:

    card            = a t_card variable containing the handle to the card. It must be obtained
                      using the hil_open function.
    pwm_channels    = an array of unsigned integers (t_uint32) containing the PWM output
                      channels whose counter values will be set. Channel numbers are zero-based. 
                      Thus, channel 0 is the first channel, channel 1 the second channel, etc.
    num_channels    = the number of channels in the pwm_channels array
    configurations  = an array of t_pwm_configuration values containing the PWM configuration for
                      each channel. There must be one element for each PWM channel 
                      specified in the pwm_channels array. Valid values are:
                          PWM_UNIPOLAR_CONFIGURATION      - the output is a single unipolar output (default)
                          PWM_BIPOLAR_CONFIGURATION       - the output is a single bipolar output
                          PWM_PAIRED_CONFIGURATION        - the output is paired with another output of like polarity,
                                                            with programmable deadband
                          PWM_COMPLEMENTARY_CONFIGURATION - like paired but the secondary output is
                                                            inverted
                      Which outputs may be complementary pairs and which outputs may be bipolar is
                      determined by the card. The QPID, for example, implemented bipolar PWM outputs
                      through the corresponding analog outputs rather than using the normal PWM signal
                      lines.
    alignments      = the alignment of the pulse within the PWM period. Valid alignments are:
                          PWM_LEADING_EDGE_ALIGNED   - the pulse starts at the beginning of the PWM period, independent
                                                       of the pulse width (default)
                          PWM_TRAILING_EDGE_ALIGNED  - the pulse finishes at the end of the PWM period, independent
                                                       of the pulse width
                          PWM_CENTER_ALIGNED         - the pulse is centered within the PWM period
    polarities      = the polarity of the output. Valid values are:
                          PWM_ACTIVE_HIGH_POLARITY  - normal polarity. The duty cycle value determines the width of the high pulse (default).
                          PWM_ACTIVE_LOW_POLARITY - inverse polarity. The duty cycle value determines the width of the low pulse.

    Return value:

    Returns 0 on success. If an error occurs then a negative error code is returned.

    Examples:

    t_uint32 channels[] = { 0, 1, 2 };
    t_pwm_configuration configurations[] = { PWM_UNIPOLAR_CONFIGURATION, PWM_BIPOLAR_CONFIGURATION, PWM_COMPLEMENTARY_CONFIGURATION };

/*
    Name:   hil_set_pwm_deadband

    Description:

    Sets the deadband of complementary PWM output channels. When two PWM outputs are configured as complementary
    by the hil_set_pwm_configuration function, the secondary channel outputs the inverse of the primary channel.
    Hence, when the primary channel is high, the secondary channel is low, and vice versa. However, a "deadband"
    may be introduced in the transition from high-to-low or low-to-high, such that the secondary output does not
    change immediately, as soon as the primary channel changes state. Such "deadband" is necessary when the PWM
    outputs are being used to drive an H-bridge or other transistor configurations to avoid two transistors in an
    H-bridge from being turned on at the same time, albeit briefly, and causing a current surge (since power would
    essentially be shorted to ground for a brief instant).

    This function allows the deadband to be specified. In fact, a different deadband may be specified for when
    the primary channel transitions from high-to-low or low-to-high, since transistor switching times may not be
    symmetric.

    The deadband may be set for any channels that are configured as bipolar, paired or complementary. Channels
    which are configured as unipolar are ignored (i.e., hil_set_pwm_deadband may be called for those channels
    but the deadband value is ignored and success is returned). Only the primary channel should have its deadband
    set. The secondary channel is ignored since its behaviour is governed entirely by the primary channel.

    Parameters:

    card                    = a t_card variable containing the handle to the card. It must be obtained
                              using the hil_open function.

                              Thus, channel 0 is the first channel, channel 1 the second channel, etc.
    num_channels            = the number of channels in the pwm_channels array
    leading_edge_deadband   = an array of doubles indicating the deadband, in seconds, to use when
                              the primary channel switches from low to high.
    trailing_edge_deadband  = an array of doubles indicating the deadband, in seconds, to use when
                              the primary channel switches from high to low.

    Return value:

    Returns 0 on success. If an error occurs then a negative error code is returned.

/*
    Name:   hil_set_pwm_frequency

    Description:

    Sets the frequency of the PWM channels. Many cards do not support PWM channels.
    Those that do may have a fixed PWM output frequency that cannot be varied. However,
    some cards, like the Quanser Q8-series, do allow the PWM output frequency to be
    configured. In fact, the frequency of each PWM output may be set individually.
    
    The range of valid PWM frequencies depends upon the card. See the card-specific
    documentation for details. PWM frequencies will be rounded to the nearest frequency
    supported by the card.

    This function should be used to configure the frequency of the PWM outputs when
    those channels are in duty cycle mode (see hil_set_pwm_mode). It is designed for
    configuring the PWM outputs, not updating their frequency every sampling instant.
    Use functions such as hil_write_pwm, hil_write_pwm_buffer or hil_task_write_pwm to 
    set the PWM output frequency for channels in frequency mode, where the frequency
    is varied continually.

    Parameters:

    card            = a t_card variable containing the handle to the card. It must be obtained
                      using the hil_open function.

                      channels whose frequencies will be set. Channel numbers are zero-based. 
                      Thus, channel 0 is the first channel, channel 1 the second channel, etc.
    num_channels    = the number of channels in the pwm_channels array
    frequency       = an array of doubles containing the new PWM frequencies in Hz for
                      each channel. There must be one element for each PWM channel 
                      specified in the pwm_channels array.

    Return value:

/*
    Name:   hil_set_pwm_duty_cycle

    Description:

    Sets the duty cycle of the PWM channels. This function should be used to configure
    the duty cycle of the PWM outputs when those channels are in frequency or period mode
    (see hil_set_pwm_mode), not duty cycle mode. It is designed for configuring the PWM 
    outputs, not updating  their duty cycle every sampling instant. Use functions such as 
    hil_write_pwm, hil_write_pwm_buffer or hil_task_write_pwm to set the PWM output duty 
    cycle for channels in duty cycle mode, where the duty cycle is varied continually.

    Since duty cycle mode is the default mode, and by far the most common, this function
    is generally never used. Most cards do not even support this function, although the
    Quanser Q8-series do. Instead, the hil_set_pwm_frequency function is used to
    configure the PWM output frequency during setup and then the hil_write_pwm,
    hil_write_pwm_buffer or hil_task_write_pwm function is used to change the PWM
    duty cycle during normal operation.

    Valid duty cycles range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a 0% duty cycle and 1 indicates
    a 100% duty cycle.

    Parameters:

    card            = a t_card variable containing the handle to the card. It must be obtained
                      using the hil_open function.

/*
    Name:   hil_set_card_specific_options

    Description:

    Sets options specific to a particular card. The options parameter is a string
    containing the card-specific options. The string typically takes the form:

        <name>=<value>,<name>=<value>,...

    where <name> is the name of an option and <value> is the option's value.
    In general, spaces should be avoided. Spaces may be contained in values
    if the value is enclosed in double quotes. For example, in the hypothetical
    options string below, the value of the vendor option contains a space so
    it is enclosed in quotes. 

        char options[] = "vendor=\"National Instruments\",terminal_board=e_series";

    Refer to the card's documentation for details on the options supported by
    the card. Many cards do not support any options since the standard HIL API
    functions cover most, if not all, of their functionality.

    Parameters:

    card            = a t_card variable containing the handle to the card. It must be obtained
                      using the hil_open function.
    options         = a string containing the options. See the standard format of this
                      argument in the discussion above. The string should be null terminated
                      although the options_size argument may be used to circumvent this
                      requirement by providing the actual length of the string.
    options_size    = the maximum number of characters that will be used from the
                      options string. If the options string is null-terminated then
                      this argument may be set to MAX_STRING_LENGTH.

    Return value:

    Returns 0 on success. If an error occurs then a negative error code is returned.

    // Configure a National Instruments PCI-6259 card for use with a Quanser E-Series

/*
    Name:   hil_task_set_buffer_overflow_mode

    Description:

    Determines how buffer overflows are handled for a task. The task buffer overflows when samples
    are not being read fast enough by task_read_xxx to keep up with the data being read by the card
    at its inputs, or when samples are not being written fast enough by task_write_xxx to stay ahead
    of the data being written by the card to its outputs. Buffering is used to handle cases where
    the application is momentarily interrupted and the size of the buffer determines how long an
    interruption is permitted. If increasing the buffer size does not prevent buffer overflow then
    the application is simply not capable of keeping up with real time.
    
    By default, an error will be returned by the next hil_task_read_xxx or hil_task_write_xxx call
    when a buffer overflow occurs and the task will need to be stopped. The reason this is the default
    behaviour is that the HIL API is intended for real-time applications where missing samples is
    regarded as a fatal error.

    However, for those applications where samples may be missed then the buffer overflow handling
    can be altered using the hil_task_set_buffer_overflow_mode function (if the card supports it).
    There are three possible modes:

    BUFFER_MODE_ERROR_ON_OVERFLOW:

    This is the default mode in which buffer overflows cause a QERR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW error to be
    returned by the next hil_tas_read_xxx or hil_task_write_xxx. The task should be stopped at
    that point.

    BUFFER_MODE_OVERWRITE_ON_OVERFLOW:

    In this mode, old samples in the buffer are discarded to make room for new samples if the
    buffer overflows. For writer tasks, this means that there may be unexpected discontinuities in
    the output waveforms. For reader tasks, it means that samples may be lost and only the more
    recent samples will be read.

    BUFFER_MODE_DISCARD_ON_OVERFLOW:

    In this mode, new samples are discarded if there is no room in the buffer. For writer tasks,
    this means that there may be unexpected discontinuities in the output waveforms. For reader
    tasks, it means that samples may be lost and only the oldest samples will be read.

    BUFFER_MODE_WAIT_ON_OVERFLOW
    
    In this mode, the task waits on buffer overflow for space to become available. This mode is
    not supported by hardware cards but is only for use by simulated cards.

    BUFFER_MODE_SYNCHRONIZE
    
    In this mode, the task provides complete buffer synchronization. This mode is not supported
    by hardware cards but is only for use by simulated cards.

    Parameters:

    task     = a t_task variable containing the handle to the task. It must be obtained
               using one of the hil_task_create_xxx functions.
    mode     = the new buffer overflow mode.

    Return value:

    Returns 0 on success. If an error occurs then a negative error code is returned.

    Examples:

    result = hil_task_set_buffer_overflow_mode(task, BUFFER_MODE_OVERWRITE_ON_OVERFLOW);

    Name:   hil_task_get_buffer_overflows

    Description:

    Returns the number of buffer overflows that have occurred since the task was started. This
    function is only relevant when the buffer overflow mode has been changed from the default mode
    i.e., when the overflow mode is not BUFFER_MODE_ERROR_ON_OVERFLOW.
    
    Parameters:

/*-------------------------- Interrupt handling ----------------------------*/

        true  = an interrupt did occur for that channel

    Note that the channel numbers for interrupt sources are assigned according to a standardized

    If an interrupt is detected, that interrupt is acknowledged so that the hil_poll_interrupt
    function only sets the state to true once for each interrupt that occurs. The next invocation
    of hil_poll_interrupt will have the state set to false unless another interrupt has occurred
    between the two calls to hil_poll_interrupt.

    Parameters:

    card         = a card opened using the hil_open function
    channels     = the interrupt sources to poll
    num_channels = the number of interrupt sources in the channels and states vectors

    Be sure to call hil_monitor_start to start the monitor initially before attempting to invoke
