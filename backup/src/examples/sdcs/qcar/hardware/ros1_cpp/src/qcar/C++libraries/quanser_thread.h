/*
    This header file defines a set of functions for creating and manipulating real-time
    threads. It is modelled after the POSIX thread functions but is modified and restricted
    such that these functions work on every QUARC target.

    A thread is created using the qthread_create function. To ensure that the thread resources
    are freed, the qthread_join function must be called for the thread prior to program exit.
    To set the attributes of the thread upon thread creation, define a qthread_attr_t variable
    and initialize it using the qthread_attr_init function. This function initializes it with
    default values. To modify the defaults, use the appropriate qthread_attr_xxxx functions.
    After creating the thread, the qthread_attr_t variable should be destroyed using the
    qthread_attr_destroy function. The same qthread_attr_t variable may be used to create
    multiple threads.

    Cancellation points are supported, as in POSIX. Under Windows, a cancellation point is
    equivalent to an alertable function. The qthread_cancel function may be used to cause
    a thread to exit at a cancellation point. Hence, stopping a thread is often achieved by
    calling qthread_cancel followed by qthread_join.

    To ensure that any necessary cleanup is performed when a thread exits, even if it is
    cancelled, cleanup handlers are also supported. A cleanup handler is pushed on the
    "cleanup handler stack" by the qthread_cleanup_push function. This function will be
    called if the thread exits or is cancelled. The cleanup handler is removed from the
    cleanup handler stack by the qthread_cleanup_pop function. The qthread_cleanup_push
    and qthread_cleanup_pop functions must be scoped as if they were curly braces.

    A few other qthread functions exist for manipulating the CPU affinity and priority
    of threads, among others.

/*
    Name:   qthread_cleanup_push

    Description:

    This function pushes a cleanup handler onto the cleanup handler stack.
    It must be matched by a corresponding call to qthread_cleanup_pop. These
    two functions must be paired in the same way as curly braces.

    When a thread exits or is cancelled, all the cleanup handlers currently
    on the cleanup handler stack are popped from the stack and executed.
    Cleanup handlers are a convenient way of ensuring that resources have been
    released when a thread exits, even if it is cancelled.

    To remove a cleanup handler from the stack, use the qthread_cleanup_pop
    function. The argument to the qthread_cleanup_pop function determines
    whether the cleanup handler is executed or not when it is popped from
    the stack.

    Note that cleanup handlers may not be used in C++ functions that contain
    objects that require stack unwinding (class objects defined on the stack
    that have a destructor). Use try/catch instead. Define a catch(...)
    condition to execute code when the thread is cancelled and rethrow the
    exception in the catch(...) handler so that the thread continues to be
    cancelled.

    Parameters:

    handler = the address of the cleanup handler routine. It must have the
              prototype:
                    void handler(void * context)
              It may be a static function so that it has file scope.
    context = the value that will be passed to the cleanup handler as its argument.

    Return value:

    This function does not return a value.

/*
    Name:   qthread_cleanup_pop

    Description:

    This function pops a cleanup handler from the cleanup handler stack.
    If the execute argument is non-zero then it executes the cleanup handler
    after popping it from the stack. Otherwise, it removes the cleanup
    handler from the stack without executing it.

    Parameters:

    execute = a boolean flag indicating whether to execute the cleanup
              handler or not. Set it to true to execute the cleanup handler.
              If it is false then the cleanup handler is not executed.

    Return value:

    This function does not return a value.

/*
    Name:   qthread_create

    Description:

    This function creates a thread. The handle to the thread is returned in the
    qthread_t variable whose address is passed in the thread parameter. Likewise,
    the identifier of the thread is returned in the qthread_id_t variables whose
    address is passed in the thread_id parameter. The thread_id parameter may be
    NULL if the thread identifier is not required. The thread identifier is the
    only way to compare threads for equality, however. This function differs from
    the POSIX pthread_create function in this regard because some QUARC targets
    differentiate between a thread handle and a thread identifier.

    The characteristics of the thread are defined by the qthread_attr_t structure
    whose address is passed in the attributes parameter. This parameter may be NULL
    to use the default thread attributes.

    The start_routine parameter is the address of a function that will be called
    as the main entry point of the new thread. The thread continues execution
    until the start_routine returns or calls the qthread_exit function. The start
    routine should be declared as:

        qthread_return_t QTHREAD_DECL mythreadroutine(void * context) { ... }

    The name of the routine is arbitrary. The routine may also be static so that
    it has file scope. Do not forget the QTHREAD_DECL and do not define a return
    type other than qthread_return_t. These quantities ensure that the code will
    work properly on all QUARC targets.

    The context argument of the start_routine will be the value passed in the
    argument parameter of qthread_create. If the address of a structure is passed
    to the thread then be sure that the structure remains valid and does not go
    out of scope (if defined on the stack) until the thread has copied it or
    otherwise used its contents. This requirement is typically satisfied by
    waiting on a semaphore in the thread that called qthread_create and signalling
    that semaphore in the start_routine of the new thread when the structure is
    no longer needed.

    To kill a thread in a graceful manner, cancel the thread using the qthread_cancel
    function. The qthread_cancel function causes the thread to exit when it reaches
    a "cancellation point", which is typically a blocking system call or the 
    qthread_testcancel function. On the QUARC Windows target, only functions that
    perform an alertable wait are cancellation points.

    To wait for a thread to exit, use the qthread_join function. The name comes
    from the POSIX pthread API and refers to the synchronization that occurs between
    the current thread and the thread being waited upon when this function is called.
    The qthread_join function returns the exit code of the thread.

    The qthread_join function MUST be called to release the resources for the thread.
    Use the qthread_cancel function if necessary to ensure that the thread will exit
    before calling qthread_join, although it is better to code the thread in such a
    way that it is guaranteed to exit when desired. 

    If the thread cannot be created then a negative error code is returned and the
    thread handle is set to INVALID_QTHREAD. Use the error code rather than INVALID_QTHREAD

    thread_id       = the address of a qthread_id_t variable to receive the thread
                      identifier of the new thread. It may be NULL.
    attributes      = the address of a qthread_attr_t structure defining the desired
                      attributes of the new thread.
    start_routine   = the function to call in the new thread (the main entry point
                      of the new thread).
    argument        = a value that is passed to the start_routine.

    Description:

    This function returns the handle of the current thread. This handle may NOT be
    used to compare threads since it may only be a placemarker to identify the
    current thread. It should not be passed to other threads to refer to the
    current thread (for example, so another thread may call qthread_cancel). Only
    the thread handle returned by qthread_create may be passed to other threads
    for such a purpose. The handle returned by this function may ONLY be used
    by the current thread.

    To compare threads, use the qthread_id and qthread_equal functions instead,
    since thread identifiers uniquely identify each thread.

    The semantics of this function differ from the POSIX pthread_self() function.
    The full semantics of pthread_self are split between two functions in QUARC:
    qthread_self and qthread_id.

    Parameters:

    This function returns the identifier of the current thread. The thread identifier

    qthread_equal function. However, the thread identifier may NOT be used in place

    to the qthread_cancel function. Code which does so is not guaranteed to work on
    all QUARC targets (and, in fact, is guaranteed to fail miserably on some
    QUARC targets).

    Only the thread handle returned by the qthread_create function may be passed
    to functions which require a thread handle, such as qthread_cancel and qthread_join.

    Name:   qthread_cancel

    Description:

    This function cancels the given thread. The thread will exit the next
    time it reaches a cancellation point. On POSIX systems, only certain system
    calls are defined as cancellation points. Refer to the documentation for
    the target operating system for details on which functions are cancellation
    points. On Windows, QUARC defines alertable functions as cancellation
    points. 
    
    Note that the QUARC communications functions qcomm_send, qcomm_receive and 
    qcomm_poll are generally cancellation points on all QUARC targets. Writers
    of protocol drivers should ensure that their driver also conforms to this
    requirement, if possible, because doing so ensures that QUARC can interrupt
    blocking I/O when the model is stopped.

    The qthread_mutex_xxx functions are not cancellation points. Hence, the
    thread being cancelled generally has the opportunity to exit a critical
    section before being cancelled.

    To ensure that a thread has an opportunity to release resources when it
    is cancelled, use the qthread_cleanup_push and qthread_cleanup_pop macros
    to push or pop cleanup handlers from the cleanup handler stack. The
    cleanup handler functions currently on the cleanup handler stack are
    invoked by a thread when the thread is cancelled. Refer to the documentation
    for qthread_cleanup_push/pop near the top of this file for more information.

    Parameters:

    thread    = the handle of the thread to cancel
    thread_id = the identifier of the thread to cancel (required by some O/Ses)

    Return value:

    Returns 0 if the thread has been marked as cancelled and a negative error
    code otherwise.
