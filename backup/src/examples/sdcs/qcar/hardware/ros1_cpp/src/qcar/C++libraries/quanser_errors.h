/*
    Error messages must ALWAYS be added to the end of the list.  NEVER add an error message
    to the middle of the list. Doing so could cause code that is already built using QUARC
    to fail when the user upgrades QUARC, or it could cause the wrong error message to be
    displayed when an error occurs. Either situation would be very confusing to the user
    who upgrades QUARC. Even if error messages would more naturally be grouped together,
    add the new error messages to the end of the list anyways. Do NOT insert an error
    message into the middle of the list.

    To create separate error messages for QUARC and QRCP, create a second comment on the
    same line for QRCP. When the error messages are generated for QRCP, this second comment
    will be used instead. See the QERR_DAQMX_CANNOT_CLEAR_TASK error message for an
    example.
