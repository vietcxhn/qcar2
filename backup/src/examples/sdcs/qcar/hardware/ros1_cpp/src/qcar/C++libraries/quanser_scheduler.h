    Scheduler Policies

    QUARC defines up to three different scheduler policies:

        QSCHED_FIFO     = threads of equal priority are executed on a first-come first-serve basis
        QSCHED_RR       = threads of equal priority are executed in a round-robin ordering
        QSCHED_OTHER    = an operating system specific policy is to be used
        QSCHED_REALTIME = specific to Mac OS X. Allows actual computation time to be requested. 

    Not all scheduler policies are supported on all platforms.

    set the CPU affinity of a process or thread so that the thread, or
    threads of the process, will only run on the specified CPUs.
    
    Parameters:

    set = the set of CPUs to initialize.

    Description:

    Sets the process affinity mask for the given process. The only

    This function restricts the set of CPUs upon which threads created
    by this process may run. The affinity mask of the current
    thread is also set. This function should be called from the main 
    thread of the process before any other threads are created because
    it is not guaranteed to set the affinity masks of threads created
    by the process prior to calling this function.

    Parameters:

    pid          = the process identifier of the process whose affinity mask 
                   is being set. Currently only the current process is supported.
    cpu_set_size = the size of the pass qcpu_set_t structure in bytes. Always

    set          = the set of CPUs upon which the process may run. Use the
                   QCPU_XXXX macros to define the CPUs in the set.
