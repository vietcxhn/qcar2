** Description:
**      Opens the ranging sensor.
**
** Arguments:
**      uri                = a URI used for communicating with the device. The VL53L1X is an I2C-based sensor supporting a 400 kHz I2C interface.
**                           Hence, the URI should reference an I2C interface if using a real device.
**      range              = the distance mode to use.
**      timing_budget      = the time in seconds allowed for the sensor to perform a reading
**      measurement_period = the interval at which the device reads the sensor. It must be at least 4ms longer than the timing_budget parameter.
**      sensor             = the address of a t_ranging_sensor variable which will receive the handle to the sensor.

/*
** Description:
**      Reads LIDAR data from the ranging sensor.
**
**      When the measurement mode is RANGING_MEASUREMENT_MODE_NORMAL, the "raw" sensor readings from the LIDAR are returned 
**      (but the values are scaled to the SI units expected). In this case, the number of measurements may vary and the angles
**      may not be consistent between scans. Furthermore, while the angles will be in ascending order, the first angle may not
**      be zero. It will, however, be close to zero. If the size of the measurements buffer provided is not large enough then
**      -QERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL will be returned. In this case, the function may be called again with a larger buffer.
**
**      When the measurement mode is RANGING_MEASUREMENT_MODE_INTERPOLATED, the raw sensor readings from the LIDAR are not
**      returned. Instead, the number of "measurements" requested will be returned, in which the angles are 360/N degrees
**      apart (in radians), where N is the number of measurements requested and the first angle is zero. The distances will be
**      interpolated from the raw data, as will the standard deviation and quality. Interpolation is only performed between two
**      consecutive valid readings. The advantage of this mode is that the angles are always consistent, as are the number of
**      measurements, so the data is easier to process in Simulink.
**
**      If no new scan data is available then -QERR_WOULD_BLOCK is returned.
**
**      If the quality is zero then it indicates an invalid measurement (no reflected laser pulse).
**
** Arguments:
**      sensor                          = the t_ranging_sensor variable which contains the handle to the sensor (handle returned by rplidar_open).
**      mode                            = the measurement mode, which determines how the scan data is returned.
**      maximum_interpolated_distance   = in interpolation mode, this is the maximum difference between the distance measurement of contiguous samples
**                                        for which interpolation will be used. Beyond this difference, the distance of the sample with the closest
**                                        angle to the desired heading will be used.
**      measurements                    = a buffer in which the actual measurement data is stored.
**      num_measurements                = the size of the measurements buffer in elements.
**
** Return value:
**      Returns the number of measurements actually copied to the measurements buffer on success. Otherwise it returns a negative
**      error code. It returns -QERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL if the supplied measurements buffer is not large enough to hold the scan data.
**      If no new data is available then it returns -QERR_WOULD_BLOCK.
