** Description:
**
** Creates or opens a named mutex. The named mutex may be shared across processes.
** If the exclusive flag is set then a -QERR_MUTEX_ALREADY_EXISTS error will be returned
** if the mutex already exists. Otherwise the mutex will be opened. The name should always
** begin with a forward slash and should not be more than 255 characters long.
**
** The mutex should be closed using qthread_mutex_close when it
** is no longer in use.
**
** Parameters:
**
** mutex     = a pointer to the qthread_mutex_t * variable in which a pointer to the mutex
**             will be stored.
** name      = the name of the mutex. It must begin with a '/' character.
** exclusive = whether to create the mutex if it already exists
**
** Return value:
**
** Returns 0 on success. If an error occurs then a negative error code is returned.

** owned by the caller. However, the caller should check for consistency of the shared
