/*
    Description:

    This function creates a timer event. Timer events are much like
    semaphores or Windows events except they are restricted to
    timers and do not maintain a count. A qtimer may be configured
    to post a timer event at each timer expiration. Wait on this
    event using the qtimer_event_wait function. The timer event may
    be signalled manually using the qtimer_event_post function.

    If timer events are shared between timers then the timer
    overrun count may report unexpected results. In general,
    timer events should not be shared between timers.

    The timer event must be deleted using qtimer_event_delete
    when it is no longer in use in order to free up system
    resources.

    Under QNX, this function is a cancellation point. It is not
    a cancellation point under Windows or RTX.

    Parameters:

    event   = a pointer to a t_timer_event variable in which to store

/*
    Description:

    This function creates a timer. The t_timer_notify structure
    indicates the type of notification to perform when the timer
    expires. Quanser timers support two notifications mechanisms:
        - a timer event
        - a timer handler
    
    Timer events are like Windows events or UNIX signals and allow
    code to wait on the event using the qtimer_event_wait function.
    Timer events are created using the qtimer_event_create function.
    To use a timer event for notification, set the notify_type field
    to TIMER_NOTIFY_EVENT and set the notify_value.event field to
    the t_timer_event handle created via qtimer_event_create.

    Timer handlers are callback functions that are invoked when the
    timer expires. Unlike signal handlers, timer handlers are executed
    in a separate thread and thus the functions called within a timer
    handler must be multithread-safe but not asynchronous-signal safe.

    This function is not a cancellation point.

    Parameters:

    notify  = a pointer to a t_timer_notify structure indicating the
              type of notification mechanism to use for the timer
    timer   = a pointer to a t_timer variable in which to store

    unless qtimer_begin_resolution returns an error.
    
    In general, the resolution may be set to the same period as the
    desired timer period. This function must be called to achieve
    sampling rates faster than 1KHz on QNX. This function is also
    useful to ensure that a given sampling rate is achievable
    prior to actually setting the timer.

    If the specified resolution is not supported because it is
    too small then -QERR_OUT_OF_RANGE is returned. If the new
    resolution is too large, then the resolution is left
    unchanged and 0 is returned.

    Under QNX, this function may be a cancellation point.

    Parameters:

    timer      = the handle to the timer
    resolution = a pointer to a t_period structure containing

    Hence, the period that can be delivered by a timer is always an
    integer multiple of the oscillator period. The actual_period returned
    by this function will be an integer multiple of the oscillator period.

    expiration and the timer expires again then a timer overrun
    occurs and the overrun count is incremented. If the timer event
    is processed before the next timer expiration then an overrun
    does not occur.

    The overrun count returned is the number of extra timer expirations
    that occurred between the time the expiration event was signaled

    the number of overruns is greater than or equal to DELAYTIMER_MAX,
