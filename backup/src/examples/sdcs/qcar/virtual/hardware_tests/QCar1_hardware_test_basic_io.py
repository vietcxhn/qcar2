'''hardware_test_basic_io.py

This example demonstrates how to use the QCar class to perform basic I/O.
Learn how to write throttle and steering, as well as LED commands to the
vehicle, and read sensor data such as battery voltage. See the QCar class
definition for other sensor buffers such as motorTach, accelometer, gyroscope
etc.
